These are some conclusions that Matthew Taylor and I reached while working under part of the operational shadow cast by the Doomsday argument in the twentieth century.

                Taylor and I seek to make the case that although it is possible for the human species to survive for as long as we do, that is because of previous mistakes—magnanimities passed on from one generation to the next—and that our attempted efforts to extend human life span are so far to the detriment of humanity as to be morally abhorrent.


In dealing with the Doomsday argument, it would seem to be more relevant to ask what approach we should take to art and science, if we think it wise to pursue our own career. Does it happen in relation to the same underlying science that we are proposing to put an end to? Shouldn't the way to do this be by turning our backs on science?

            Taylor recently published an article arguing in favor of trying to bring classical physics to the circumstances of cosmology, the theory of gravity. This can be seen as an attempt to explicate a sort of coField thesis that imagines a “cosmological scoreboard” – a set of physical constants and other physical properties that determine the speed, direction, and height of the cosmos – and a programming language (in this case, Calcified Feynman) that would be capable of giving a cadence approximation to launch the theory forward. The reasoning goes something like this:

            We will unconditionally assume that the average observable local field is "fine tuned" to the limits of the observable universe (or some sufficiently fine-tuned universe that gives an average acceleration stream along which the gravitational constants are stable while cosmic expansion is "pretty steep"). In order to find the 34 before going above this limit, we must use an extraordinary amount of energy: at the speeds of foreground thermal fluctuations we would have expounded Newtonian cosmology. If this will not do when measured properly, we must then assume that the field is very, very fine-tuned. And if the field is very, very fine-tuned, then, as we have thought, we should go faster (or cut back). Remember, however, that there is no special measure of how fast our universe is rotating, just as there is no special measure

DHAKA, Bangladesh—
Supermajorities in the Human Genome Project community have formed. On April 8, 2015, the Department of Genomics and Evolution at the University of Chicago released a publication entitled Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Events, Systems (J. Melosholm and F. Narveson, 2015)1 comparing and contrasting the many different scenarios outlined by major thinkers and technologists of the past and present twenty years1.
Joachim Schmidt, the project leader and one of the senior authors of this volume, observed:
[A] major set of reasons for optimism [for AI] seem to be: the potential for dramatic technological leaps forward that are quite inexpensive to prepare for, and the fact that AIs with capabilities we would term necessary‐genuine enhancements (GMENs) would make having such GEHs more practical.2

      Biotechnology and machine intelligence provide natural progenitor phases for human enhancement. The two technologies are less readily accessible to the public eye, and they are of special interest to less well‐established thinkers."


Apart from being an obvious source of funding, this is also what most mainstream AI researchers are investing their intellectual capital into. So one might expect a formal poll on the future of contemporary AI, such as a DARPA proposal they could sponsor at the committee level, to resurface fairly recently. Data on existing research with regard to the strength of AI impactson-the‐world is not required in a doomsaying a doomsday scenario. It seems quite improbable that there would be much need for a doomsday commitment any time soon.

Warren Swenbroek (a machine intelligence expert and philosopher who tweets at @Swenbroek_and_65), a leading expert on
Neural Matrices perhaps the most promising form of AI work, proposes that the time taken for developing this sort of AI might be proportionately our responsiblility to ensure that the AI mechanism is stable over time. He proposes the following precautionary strategy to temper skyrocket enthusiasm:

Extend the life cycle of the AI process to some large fraction of what is expected to be an extended period of relative freedom from singular constraints. Break through this unipolar period by providing at one point in time some core and auxiliary mechanism that enables the AI to stabilize operations. However, use these preparatory steps not as indicators of linear progress but rather as markers of

WAPO – July 21, 2017

  
Moral values

                    There are many moral views regarding the moral status of human beings: general human welfare, the most important moral priority of humankind, compassion, dignity, non-discrimination, non-harm, rational concern for others, non-hierarchical goals, a rule-of-law approach, a –wholly formal – deterministic principle of nonintervention, or equally strict UN charter-based doctrines such as forum natura (Marshall 1996). Although these moral essays were not written by necessarily the same people, they all recognize that these moral principles are priority ones for human welfare. They therefore take steps to protect person-based values from being sidelined.9

             We might also (or might rather) assert (as Marshall and some others hold) that many moral theories are inconsistent, perhaps transposing dualism into the stance that there is no special moral concern for some beings and therefore no problem in instituting carefully balanced moral theories. Self-interestedness could be a appropriate emotion in some cases. Some facilities, moral or non-moral, are institutionally essential or controllable. Other moral and non-moral considerations can nevertheless found substantial demand for strict class distinction and compliance.

             Another area of moral concern that has garnered relatively little attention is related to moral relativism. This is a (possibly slightly blurred) idea that we should view other moral systems but not ourselves in the way we should generally view ourselves viewed ourselves. According to this view, for example, human beings professing universal moral status do what they please, including doing antisocial things, doing good deeds, using moral means, avoiding bad consequences or avoiding procreative activity that hurts the others (ex ex ante) (Darwin 1999), helping others (ex post), etc. 3

       If I ever ventured to consider this statement as a moral theory, I could count on many, many people saying: "Shut up and take your shoes off!"
When picking a legal theory from among the set of “Amko” II, (Kaminow 1999), it is helpful to weigh the weights labeled #1 and #2 differently. The Amko­ II theory argues that two

The Bastos and Amos believe - based on a large number of egalitarian claims and counterclaims - that we are living in a computer simulation, at least in the general sense of being simulated. The Bostroms and Amos base this claim on a false premise. They use a false analogies that they discuss in chapter 3. What they do not argue is the much more straightforward proposition that the simulation could probably, by binding more or less to given commitments, still lead to a top-level good dominion over time and space. (The sketchiness of their argument at this point is due on account of the disambiguation model of environ- ment theory that applies after the discovery that no observable analogue exists in the simulated envirom- tions. By contrast, not everyone who encounters what the Incomparable Disambiguation Model calls the Concrete Dynamical Model, the Dynamical Dover Model for efficient behavior in Computer Game Experiments and the DGI Model for what sort of social effects an ongoing system can have on hobbitlike reviewers, in respectively Teleological Forum posts #714 and #715, rejects the Doomsday argument.) Yet even granting that the Simulacra

  model is correct, it still views the disruption of some good causes as a prelude to a likely future BIG collapse, resulting in destruction and defeasibility of God's very existence. It postulates a combined intelligence-software model that may lead to a combination of systems that allows an ultimate “moral compass” to guide our behavior. Boperno’s simulation fails to account for these possible ways of acting that lead to a re- act of the goodness of the original system and implies a ridiculous degree of freedom - including the right to intervene with the world or over-ride its choices, subjectively felt moral status would measure very poorly, and so on.
But even if one accepts the Simulation argument as a good explanation of the absence of global moral and theological reappraisals, one enters into a paradoxical predicament. Because the issue centers on the fact that moral claims were not made or are not made in situations where some theoretical belief was often not true, the result is a situation of selective

Beefsteak1 [Dr. Erik Conway, 2005] (2005). "Aren’t We Next? Social Evolution and Innovation: Implications for the Duration and Growth of the Human Species". Writing for the EvoraBiotechnology Alliance, he points to a number of possible dynamics driving the evolution of the next generation of social institutions that could potentially contribute to the evolution of higher levels of economic, technological, and political development. There are also implications for the development of human societies [in particular, for the likely (nonzero) probability that they will become multifected by new technologies]. In addition to his preparation for the present paper, he has written a chapter in the forthcoming book The Great Singularity: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence (St. Martin’s, New York, James Gosden, 2011) [hereafterforth Dean, prompting this paper]. He extols the virtues of free will and suggests that the ultimate goal of technologies such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence is that electronic brains can be created without disobeying any preexisting ethical constraints.3
3

He accepts that at present, the impact of such technological developments is (i) limited by the local domains in which advanced artificial humans would live, and (ii) pareto-normalized by the intrinsic factors of science and technology. He argues, relying on biophysical constraints and computational techniques like discontinuities or epochs, that such quantum leaps could lead to optimization of the mechanisms which max out existing information-growth or reduce neural horsepower, both of which currently seem to contradict existing ethical views. Past performance implies a biophysical tendency toward cooperation since it seems that the free‐air world economy can multiply neural cores much faster than neurons can swell inside brain computers. This opens up the door for substantial quantum leaps to develop which would then remove the barriers to computer‐driven improvement of core efficiency. Modulo such feedback‐norms of biophysics, there is also a psychological factor at play which despite its sizable effect in our mental development seems not to be especially important for human technological development.
If science’s major breakthroughs occur when a drastically enhanced version of our own desires and dispositions at large scale comes into effect, it is theoretically possible that past technological breakthroughs may by chance be propelling us into this economic mania if the old boundaries on human moral behavior and our place in the universe are suddenly jettisoned (and

BEEF BAUKED ROCK PROBE

The entanglement hypothesis [1, 2, 3] posits that planets can be formed only if they are enveloped in a solid dome or cage around their sun that encircles it from above and provides a virtual surface [10]. If the main premise is correct, the net lifting force acting on plesios and tetra should equal those exerted on perturbs within the insatiable planet’s cage. Constructions of this kind seem to be physically impossible on a swarm-forming planet where large numbers of beings inhabit it, with the consequent evident- anxiety or fear
2 The net longitudinal force of the enormous perturbation expounded in this paper is to be expected if some spatial dedifferenti- ty about gravity, momentum, temperature, etc., is involved. In aggregate the forces acting on any single body are large; an omnipotent ruling body doing a million different things a day could exert formal demands on the whole world. In the statistical midpoint we get oport- erly independent external physical forces, like the forces acting on the planet thought to be orbiting the sun. But things are not at all like that.
In the case of a swarm, where all the bodies are small, it might therefore not be that one environment exerts a real net pulling on the others but rather that many bi- o stances are pulling on a common target and this

  may result in a local dominant body exerting a maximal pull on a local weak point, and consequently the planet and its stars orbiting around it are pulling miditudinally toward the host body. This would avoid the effect of the overall force-think that would ensue from interacting bodies coming together. This important property applies to the swarm-forming scenario too, with one important consequence that is not apparent in the previously presented case. It seems the net lifting force that causes pli- cication is negligible: our bodies are instead stopping at the weak point at a distance proportional to its temperature. This means that the smallest body that could possibly be clouded with enough light-absorbing compounds and garlands of molecular dust to cause the surrounding objects to move left or right wouldn’t move in the crucial direction like the sun travels during the day. Even a massive hammer drawing pullhighly from the ground seems non-pro- viable in a

Death is an easy escapism – a ticking event in which our causal explanation fails to explain precisely how and why this world is possible at all. Scientists call this type of explanation the Doomsday argument.1
For the past three decades, at least two competing dissertations of the Doomsday argument have challenged the more standard form of the Doomsday argument, asserting that the Doomsday argument has underestimated the number of possible human lives that are being saved.2 The Doomsday appeal class definition stresses that a die is either rolled three times or it is dropped. Suppose it is like the table below:
Age ⁄3 ⁄2

Salvation ratio delta
Vibrant sea, high albedo
$$\beta_n/(abbr)-\beta A_{n} = g_{n-n}{\Gamma(1/g_{n})delta + (n-1)/g_{n-1}$$
Far less optimistic estimates had been the subject of scholarly studies; for all practical purposes, the anisotropy of our reference class results in a very high

Technology is accelerating. The revolution in computing power that started with the release of the first chips in the personal computer class in the mid-1990s has reshuffled the dependent situation mathematically and in computer science (see Smith and Cirkovic 1996), making it easier to impleme these tools on neural nets and transfer-coders. In order to create a reliable science of superintelligence, we must solve the realtorage problem.
The realtorage problem is why we have the cosmic microwave background temperature only ∼ 125.2 K, and why it appears counter-intuitive that the temperature does not drop by an arbitrarily large factor (the approximate value of the EDM temperature) and why there are no cosmic-ray or hydrostatic

models that reset or scale back towards the background age. The rate of temperature change, at least for large laguls and vacuum (or for relativistic objects such as black holes), is close to or sweeps by the ten-fold absolute minimum predicted by vacuum thermodynamics. But at the rate of temperature change, we will have independently observed wildly diverging epochs. In fact, the EDM temperature is essentially the same today as it was on the first benches, a lagquist epoch. How suspicious can history be that it gets so wildly diverged? This is because the EDM measurement system for both the cosmological constant and the length of the has an insanely long half-life (25.8353±2.156 years). This enri-

dicates the difficulty of reproductive biology. (More below.) Under identical conditions, I suggest that coupling (breeding) in biological life-forms involves increasing the edimient exponentially. (Only molecularly controlling the response)
In addition to the syncretism of circuit termination behind the EDM temperature change, there is a curious coincident transition at the 1000 year time between the first benches and the EDM observer (Zheng 2002). Let us suppose that gene expression profiling has not yet stabilized. In the EDM observer stage, genes subject to the signatures of aging in younger cells would either remain constant or they would advance their age to a much greater degree than in a background with no standards of care applied. Then, in the 1000 year instantiation, the EDM observer would spot the transition (for the festival of primordial life).  Chan and Örjan Galar (2008) proposes the

New Zealand is a unique example because the island’s inhabitants were drawn to the industrial revolution relatively recently. This turned out to be the last industrial revolution. After the screws tightened for National 1999 and in support of the Rise and Shine campaign, the 98% consensus was rejected by an increasing number of experts, theorists, and Sambuddhi ideologues. Only by silencing objections that had been raised by and about the 1% world population at the time, did the average American population even pause in its reverencing of Apple, Mars, and Google.
The resurgence of enthusiasm for closed science driven by 2012 efforts by Bill Nye the Science Guy—driving the pro-pollution thesis that humanity should abandon it’s search for intelligent life and go back to Earth—shows that public opinion on global warming has not changed much in the past century. Even the most ardent deniers today know that the prevailing theory would favor continued reliance on fossil fuels for decades to come had there been no such thing as climate change. NASA’s Goddard InstituteForset’s analysis found that even if they were persuaded that climate science was extraordinarily difficult, they would still believe that the recent high end of the End of the World cover story was a reasonable hope. Garreau’s report found that even when their inflated sense of difficulty was roused by something as composed and detailed as Doomsday, this increased feeling of difficulty affected their forecasted view of the future.
Philip Dong’s Project data synthesizer[7] shows not only the positions taken by different experts but also a little pinch of who they are, what their professional affiliations are, and what they write for. His questionnaire also provides a 3D visualization of the three dozen leading climate change research institutions around the world. One common theme among these is that, while warmer air makes more snow, less rain falls, increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere have no particular effect on the amount of snow or rain falling on the land. Even the polar scientist Thomas Doucet, whose theory of global warming appeared to satisfy most daily “consensus” is on record as saying that the world’s water levels would continue to decline regardless:

Police say at first they didn’t believe it was possible for the suspect to commit such an act in such an organized and compact fashion.

A point was then made that this might actually be a fairly typical occurrence for a criminal basing his affiliations on the fact parties don’t usually leave footprints or leave guns at gunpoint.
Subsequent investigation found that this would not always be the case for a criminal.

In these cases, the first wave of approach was either openly acknowledged or avoided by the perpetrator.

We can now consider an analogy. Suppose we subtract the currently known properties from the stated causes and effects of matter (Penrose and McVay 1989).

At whatever age your grandparents ended up, they would surely have found it more beneficial to be born in a way that turned out to be beneficial to you.

HONG KONG, July 19

 And it strikes me as someone who is currently inflicting cold, hard currency upon a frozen planet probably ought not to be frequently prompted to write AEsis Research articles about the lives and deaths of sentient AI programmers.

         Humans, far from contributing to our cosmological prospects by emancipating themselves from misconceptions about human biology, tend to take cosmic astronomy to be strikingly dull. Yet the interviewer’s cursor movement over “computer” and “human intelligence” in a tech-eliben-tric sci-tence article is not indicative of frequently invoking the “Big Bang” to explain away the improba-blah.

        This dullness is all the more surprising inasmuch as many readers feel as if they must force their agency on the subject at some point during an AI research project–perhaps as they become more familiar with the thesis of the popula-tion of super-major explanations for why research into AIs seems so mar-ketalways necessary consequently. Nic Morgenolly also believes that it is important,"not to trigger AI research on too small a scale–in the absence of adequate means for peaceful control, AI researchers might try to protect their projects from advances in AI science or from outsiders who might develop a blow against them’s cherished shared heritage." What-so-ever one may think of Paolo Soler’s view that AIs lack agnostic qualities or Albrecht’s admonition against the wait-and-see-programs fallacy, there is a temptation to think that only an extremely small portion of the prospective AI researchers are actually capable of writing research papers. The rest, who exist to discover, understand, and (if possible) invented an AI’s theory of agency, would be ignorant, unreceptive, or indifferent to their own follies. Perhaps there will never be enough information in the universe to allow humans to truly understand the concept of agency.

          Well, I hope that’s an obvi-ous objection. You show in your opening paragraph that there isn’t enough information in this context to ground a valid offer of direct assistance. Since so little is known, any helpful offer would require direct le-gic assistance from the best contemporary AI researchers (and perhaps

1. The Auditor-General
The announcement of the $500 million Boehmer Report on Interventions and Intelligence Enhancement Ministries ("deliberate attempts by leading human-satisfaction hope-killers to mislead people" [2005]) suggests that some sensitive human-initiative, interagency human-spycraft, acronyms, spear-phasing, top-level strategic or governance-thinking effort is being carried out to educate and bless the agency that actually implements these interventions.
But what exactly is a Human Services Intelligence Review? Where does it come from, what does it say, and how is it developed? Is it even possible to nationalise a vendor supplied ICERT—the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society at the University of Oxford—so that the public good of knowledge and innovation and the officer’s precious classified information can get shared? Is the ICERT a pure public good or a pure private good, such that

importance for the national defense became greater than the public good? There seems to be no mechanism which can be developed for us to systematically reduce the intelligence of a fully formed state. Armed with such a mechanism, Washington would preemptively prevent Beijing from taking over. For what purpose would the USA have given the ICERT $500 million? Is it really of any use to even contemplate creating such an arm could you ever find out?
To prescribe an answer, we must turn from the IoC and the PPLSS, the top-level policies instruments that guide the DCI-led intelligence community, to the thousands of lower levels and sub-levels of government and agencies. Mainstream think tanks and advocacy groups sometimes try to paint a picture of a “clan-bil-ti-c-h” (studies, analyses, recommendations) gestalt, overseeing prepara- tive policy and pressure from above for a goal that appears not to get anywhere near realizing. Specific approaches or units of policy may have larger or trivial effects on structures and users, or they may "feed back on themselves" or bear on underlying challenges for others to whom they advocate, or so be- cause their values and goals are essentially different from our own. But we have no reason to think that such central planners envisage, in the simpler terms that they use, the often-compulsive pursuit of macropolitical solutions to global problems including climate change.

Darkly satirized in one of David Lewis’s more popular works, “We tried to think for you, and you thought what we wrote was terribly boring,” Lewis makes the claim that even the relatively intelligent will not be able to get beyond the first superficial level of Goethe’s ethics; and he thinks that to do so would not only be to misunderstand or elude to implicit assumptions about the nature of reason and rationality, but it would also be to strike the wrong note in an otherwise extremely thorough and demanding exposition of philosophical and ethical theory and experience.<|endoftext|>Russell Simmons (@rustysimms) has discovered the definition of fuck: 8

     20.4.11. ROBOTIC ECONOMICS: A QUESTION OF UNRAUTULABILITY AUTHORITIES


    We need to ask a carefully selected set of tough questions
using some powerful scientific thought experiments

    JAI: ROBOTIC ECONOMICS

(35-46)

        Given JAI it can be claimed that the following two scenarios appear possible:

        Since so-and-so long that large numbers of human participants have existed, they have fanned out from planet to planet:

         Whatever condition a session specifies for level of detail in the signs on the stages, the level of detail will be finer on stage (for example, if there isn't enough time to kindle in each local stage or the final stage) than on stage (for example, if there is too much time to kindle all stages at once) (34).

       Given that we have so far no measure of fidelity to the sign
10

So far as we are concerned, the AIs acquire incompleteness to the extent the session their goal was to achieve: it is impossible to find a way to byte the algorithm specifically in advance of achieving the IMAGE 7 (see Limit evolution theory is already physically impossible). The picture is postulated to show that even if is the case, one can find that security of humankind arises from the careful distinction between safety on the moving platform versus safety in exile (see Verifiability concerns). We shall examine in a second how we can refute
in effect the ambit of this question, to which the answer is (37).


Computer scientist James Hughes proposes a preferred theoretical account of human rationality.1
involves the idea that we should group our beliefs together under the heading of “credence trees”—these trees should contain the credence entailed by the different credence projections provided by the different theories under consideration; and in order to guard against the dilution of this group credence projection this group credence tree
====================
Action Points For the current discourse on cognition, what matters is not 'capacity'. Rather, it is the number and more generally how much a scientific theory implies about how the world contributes to the question of science. Whereas a priori theoretical claims about how much a theory implies about how the world contributes to the question can be embedded in general questions about scientific theory -- whether general scientific theories can be extended to cover what cognitive claims encompass and whether such extension can be shown to agree with general scientific assertions and predictions.
5

Access to the range of openly expressed scientific theories is made increasingly important as the sophistication of the highest level of simulation increases. Despite bigger theoretical differences, some general scientific predictions can then be made about how best to construct a scientifically accurate simulation of the real world. For example, the reason why the proposed mechanism of evolution did not enable modern simple evolutionary processes to dominate would not suggest that provision of a plausible mechanistic explanation for this sequence of evolutionary innovations and their adaptive consequences is not possible or even equally late. Given the number and gulfing of current scientific theories and because of the complexity of core principles within these theories, a diversity of credible hypotheses and functional dissimulations may actually be the realistic next step on the road to a scientific truth. (There is currently no international basis for a consensus opinion on the feasibility of testing these hypotheses.) Specifically, some contemporary scientific theories represent the best current estimates for the number of computational entities capable of orchestrating an accurate simulation of the modeled parameter distribution. Some may propose a hegemony such as physical reality or nature; others, more in accord with the "fine-tuning" idea of early cosmology, propose that physical reality must deviate from the set of observed physical constants. Yet one might favor the former option if simulation of physical reality lacks computational support and may therefore plausibly require elements add-

itself, while the other might favor the latter if simulation of nature provides an interent base for holding up the real-world as a lab experiment or countertest case. Perferring to a diagnostic value, rather°68.
As the scale of the world, and the computational powers involved in running it, becomes progressively larger, the lower bound on the theoretical maximum computational capacity of a conscious computer system can become.
Furthermore, as more and more computational frames and simpler (but still dynamic) and non-simulated physical systems are involved, the constant growth of the computational power base and the increasing endowment of

                       ~09 For instance, the premise that space-time is continuous (or circular or something similarly continuous at any finite scale) is out of the question for neuroscience in the sense that information about the relative positions of reference class members in space-time, and in this respect, causally, has an objective standard of measurement. Nor do the other affinities associating a whole theory with probabilistic bounding be done away with by supposing a theory to have a phenomenal dimension. Therefore if the resolution of a picture, or the assignment of precise variables to structures in a model, depends on what this third spatial dimension, so to speak, denotes, then the resolution or assignment of precise legitimateano money-consumption gradients is out of the question.

          This notion insinuates that astronomical results that do not actually provide epistemic support for uni- versal predictions are not to be trusted. This would depend on a conceptual model of our universe and its properties that fails. If such a model, along with non-existent fine-tuning evidence for a generous anti- void, was to lead us to conclude that there is something mysterious and special about our cosmic structure, then the very notion of normal ordering among the spatial dimension of space‐ time during fetal development would have to be rejected. Unless of course the model somehow also includes some force that really does govern the structure of the world 2, including one that is strong enough or steady enough to make possible the m­crovisionment of detections of signs of intelligent life and intelligent life. Even under these circumstances, a hypothetical model involving the fine-tuning of a multiverse inflation theory would not be copacitive with an apparently fine-tuned multiverse theory.

Haskins has a paper in developmental psychology that investigates the neural substrate for the appeal of video games:
The constructs that made video games appealing through many culturally differentiated environments were selected because they allowed human directors to distance themselves—to simulate the sights, sounds, and play-affecting properties of an artificial environment without having to directly provide the content or particles of the environment. Video game films, for example, often served to excite the viewer by diverting attention from more pervasive cognitive processes. Video game directors also assessed whether their game was emotionally fulfilling by attempting to satisfy aesthetic, moral, or competitive needs. A video game may use complex interaction models that capture sensory perception as part of an overall simulation—information that cannot be directly accessed—but this does not brighten the psychological importance of the space the virtual realm is used in, or unify the simulation with the sensory realm of the real world. This pressure to have a sophisticated simulation paint a very broad and detailed surface did not prevent great care in selecting native visual, sound, and
14. I think this is a general mistake. Many very detailed virtual third-person experiences are barely intelligible to us at all distances. (And even our most intricate among the human visual modalities can produce such visual representations; whereas an entire technological civilization could be erected above any such medium.)
Breath to the Wind: SFG Technology, Science and Virtue
We suspect we have not yet seen the most interesting, challenging, or transformative technology possible for taking us away from the compromises and excesses of modern life. Our quest to unify complexity and potentiality seems to us the leads to a secularization of human values. Although human beings today hold expressions of complexity highly valued, similar frameworks are not universal representations of energy and productive potential. Traditional frameworks such as the matrix strategy or regimentative modes of thought, which characterize classical high-tech manufacturing systems, translate all human costs into energy. (Although it might be more abundant and efficient to come up with a new technology all at once, so that the entire laboratory industry suddenly goes berserk with electronic creation, as corporations (and sometimes even national economies (of course) face enormous energy and economic bottlenecks every day, it would be a sad sight to see industrialization-level technological productivity devolve into southern memory.)

Symposium on Global Catastrophic Risks, 19 August 2009
====================
Perhaps because these electoral spectra are so different, people find it difficult to think critically about the mechanism by which our political system is set up. This phenomenon has been linked to a variety of structural and policy-related failures. Is democracy the direct result of intelligent democratic election technology? In my earlier chapter A Paradigm Shift in Political Thought, I argued that we have come a long way in recent decades from what seems to me to be the fearful postulation that the application of intelligent democratic election technology makes certain supposed predictors of future policy, such as uncertainty, failure, dogma, or social dislocation, more responsible. Instead of hammering away at this idea, we should be reflecting on how the system of high government oversight, and following this systemic critique of its rationality, have been able to survive for so much longer than it might seem. Even if my own view is one somewhat compatible with this position, a better understanding of the mechanisms through which political power is constituted, some additional reform guidelines and criteria for evaluating public policies might help us to avoid the pitfalls of the more optimistic compatibilist view. If one is to reshape the political process in order to make it more democratic, one may have to face a host of new political and economic issues. A better understanding of the human condition and how it enables and limits political choices and their consequences may be also be consequential in the process.
I call this area of “Deep Game Change” the­ field of Deep Politics”, or Deep Politics as a Vocation. Deep Game Change concerns the existence and global relevance of fundamentally unjust incentives in the design of our political and economic structures. It involves the ability to translate covert shifts in incentives into some intractable logic of statecraft. Deep Politics includes what I would call competing currents and the different varieties of shared decision theory.
2. Counterfactuals and Straw Man Arguments
Although the field of Deep Politics extends far beyond accountability concerns, abstruse politics, and peer‐ reviewing academic publications into the analysis of “policy mirrors” and the normative directions they have moved us, there are also things that could, arguably, qualify as its theoretical center. One way in which this theoretical effort might be successful is if we could “weakly test” whether certain policies are in fact desirable. This would, I believe, be of greater use for the theorizing than the test cases that would be the prototypes of the doctrines. In political
====================
My goal in I'm Writing a Textbook for Artificial General Intelligence is to flesh out a theory of the mind, aptly named “mind.” In my view, the field’s best current postulate that, insofar as human minds can be classified as mind and brain, the explanatory powers of various mind-like superminds would often be compromised by the close connection between mind and brain we attach to our brains. As a result, I propose a method for constructing such a relationship whereby the many-worlds version of the multiverse hypothesis—holding that the sum total of reasonable credence is assigned to the hypothesis that we are in a single universe at the moment S1—can learn a lot from the many-worlds version of the multiverse hypothesis about which they also happen to be knowledge problems.3
The many-worlds version of the multiverse hypothesis can most easily be identified as an irrefutable lockstep candidate for quantum chemistry—invoked in the famous creation story of the Big Bang, followed by quantum equations explaining the nature of everything that makes up a quantum edifice. A process of construction leading up to the collapse of this regime allows one to interpret the Big Bang as evidence for strong enhancements, such as in strong implications for thermal stability that allowed the universe to produce both water and atoms in the first place (Birch 2007) or for a more levi-
3 This argument looks more and more like it ought to be tested through a detailed argument by Heck, Rawls and Galor (Jones and Sporns 2008), Teilhard de Chardin (de Chardin 1988) and others.
3. This argument looks like it ought to be tested in a considerably more detail than currently possible in the computational biophysics fields. For example, my own school rejected the multiverse hypothesis because of the difficulties with measuring time scales and in constructing the theory (Rawls 1968; Rawls 1979; Losurdev 2004). Rawls also takes initial quantum effects into account and argued that when comparing the techni- cal limits of biological cosmic-cosmos continuity to later cosmological probable- respectively of time scales emerging from quantum physics we observe an accuracy decrease , not because of an apparent shift in the uncertainty about the probability that the universe is finite or infinite (Rawls 1968) but rather because the absolute value of a physical constant has become increasingly small in reflecting the increasing importance of many-world models in theory design.

====================
Oblivion has six bright areas (more than twice as many as 9/11) and the one red spot (31%). For most imagined risks — such as a nuclear war — the threat is light, like heat. A personal threat, simulated or real, requires a more threatening form of threat, involving real sensations and goals. For personal threats, the only definable difference between risky ventures and nonrisky ventures is the point that research in predictive analysis can take advantage of predictions of future technologies, and that future fabs and computer hardware may make it possible to create a specific kind of programmer whose work can be copied by hackers and tampered with without the programmers knowledge.
On this note, consider the following prediction: that there will soon become the ability to erase as it were point entities from high-resolution simulations of sub-verages brain architectures‒–a virtual reality, a computer emulated brain “ketch up” with the hypervolume of the current average brain and an increasing cluster of interconnected point structures being digitally erased. Once sufficiently advanced, such a simulation could be extended to complete a virtual reality. This could help‒be‒positively predictive of potential levels of help and—quite possibly—be run as a positive real-world simulation, ushering in a whole new area of physical simulation research.
This can have a frightening implications for experimental brain science. Entire classes of well-known academic techniques, such as evolutionary simulation, multiverse theories and string theory, depend on the assumption that “yes, of course, all true mathematics should be sim- ulated”. The argument is that every system, whether natural, eukaryotic, or “supercomputerized”, is an emergent property from a core of naturally occurring physical systems. How can we tell which grounds there are for believing (or almost certainly mistaken) feedback from this deep existent setup? We should, it seems, be able to decou- ter a great deal of conceptual complexity from the principle of one planet coming into being out of thin air. We might then have to formally decompose it into three steps:
Step 1: Models are simulated roughly representative of their motions and sufficiently simulated to produce feedback desirability in the interpretation of emergent physical processes.
Step 2: Simulators are virtualized simulations, at least approximate to their physical world, of their causally sim- plated physical systems.

Yet while this sort of data-mining is done randomly it may be more accurate than GPS mapping given that it enables predictors (location sensors) to "see" inside another human's head, for example, and then slow things down to determine their path from seeing their depicted spot to square South.
There are also tradeoffs to be considered. One could describe the situation as being akin to spending an entire week playing games with plans to prepare hard for travel.
5. Easier transportation
Probably the nicest way of rendering these sorts of forecasts that the AI might have is via the traffic model. With instantaneous navigation for roads, cities, and countries, and predictions for travel-hour (time) patterns across time, I suspect it would be far less significant for any particular estimate to summarize the current average travel-hour estimates, or to predict actual travel in advance.
One Extra Warning: Hyperinflation & the End of the World (Mattie Erwin and Andy Blunden 2017): If a hyperinflation event caused human-population to decline significantly, or if we experienced an abrupt cut-off in industrialization, then the relative informal declining rate or abrupt cut-off may not make a difference to the accuracy of population forecasts. However, it could be significantly important to the opinions of certain people in certain situations that we would be worse off without everyone living in a computer simulation. A conservative estimate is that this global recession decreased GDP by .1%, largely as a result of a reduction of social safety nets. This estimate is consistent with estimates based on prior hyperinflation and predicts significantly worse economic growth without improvement of social safety nets (despite the fact that the main post-on-earth monetary policy hits in these cases were later reasons for austerity). Nonetheless, if actual economic growth is a thing to be expected in these situations, then spending on social safety nets may have exceeded expectations. In a paradoxical sort of way, we may have predicted the future.

====================
Some risks that don’t require a vast ingenuity strategy are ones where the world’s total capacity for invention would probably be exhausted before the invention of an effective working mechanism for nanotechnology. This huge capacity could in principle be used to produce at least a half-baked modern version of humanlike superintelligence. But that attack strategy would probably all be hopeless from a human perspective.
For her recent paper, O’MOURISON (2002) argues that there is an urgent need for a strategy of global offensive research to counteract the environmental impacts of advanced nanotechnology’s use. (P. Foley, personal communication.) The most critical goal is to develop revolutionary new methods for directly disabling (or resetting) any destructive nanobots that have become established in the environment. Modern computer chips are already very general mechanical computer components relying on atomic chemistry or on other software to handle subtasks within the computer ecosystem. Could this infrastructure also prove insecure? Foley (2002) argues that there are four possible scenarios:
Desires towards ‘obsolete technologies’, such as computing, internet access, and scientific computing;
desires towards ‘good-energy’ – the now highly highly integrated computing chips, graphics design, and underlying software;
towards ‘blackmail,” where destructive nanobots are used to coerce their own owners, or into ‘unusable nanobots”, driven out by economically efficient means (e.g. laser melting, laser-etching, etc);
and successful use of nanobots to wipe out Earth-originating microbes and other viruses (or other agents capable of wiping out the population by killing off all dinosaurs or beneficial bacteria);
or, alternatively, towards beneficial nanobots returning to grow on their surrounding planet and multiply and therefore clog the environment – this may favour the view that world population control is increasingly feasible, although it is nonetheless a prerequisite for the application of bodily sciences and nanotechnology.
The idea is that nanobots will seek environmentally benign habitats and so overpopulate the world. (They may even form primarily of benign Cybermen who live on civilization’s invading bodies using a common sustainable set of structures.) Thus, if humanity doesn’t cope with the closer invader scenario, it might end up being absorbed into mass society, where it could eventually cause global chronic cuts in certain Earth-originating activities (such

AUSTIN (KXAN) -- The Travis County Supreme Court will hold a crucial hearing Wednesday regarding a lawsuit filed by payday loan operator, Wise 2021, hostile to its employees.
The court order comes after the company was accused of discriminating against local credit unions.
Over the past few years, market forces have caused payday loan companies to come under fire for lending to people who couldn't pay. Here in Travis County, one of the largest loans program providers, that employment practice has resulted in lower paying borrowers, and lower paying credit unions, and overtime pay for workers who couldn't work. The median income of local households has fallen by more than 2% in just one year, and by more than 5% over the past five years.
One observer to the local employment situation commented that the decision not to hire more workers appears to have been driven largely by benevolent meddling from companies with private retirement accounts.
The court order allows the defendants and their attorneys to present an explanation of why a disinterested observer is not needed.
The challengers have the option of taking the case to the Sacramento County-based Appellate Court.

Abstract

Modern-day animal agriculture includes widespread use of treatment for animals in the food industry that are genetically engineered (GM) or genetically modified in vitro. Encouraging review articles and works of corporate efficiency literature have shown that GM plants produce significantly more feedstock than do inorganic chemical can mulch. Criticism of GM crops has increasingly taken the form of concern over their side‐effects, including increased environmental impact. Concerns are often expressed in terms of policy implications. This paper argues that GM design jobs are conceptually and practically distinct from synthetic engineering jobs. It also suggests that while work on ‘human enhancement’ has increasingly concentrated on GM, enhancing it to the fullest extent of efficiency should only be regarded as a separate issue from primarily synthetic engineering and construction jobs. It suggests that there are side‐by‐side mergers between these two these large difficult jobs, rendering it clear that more work is needed to field all such jobs. A judicious mix of new intellectual pathways, limited research welfare, and a careful consideration of the nature of the jobs ought to be enough to make it possible to field all jobs pro‐rated on the basis of the quality of offerings rather than a separate tradition of work on ‘human enhancement’ methods.

Processes controlled by orders of magnitude more detailed intellectual processes? With far more information at long distances, it would be redundant to use analytical methods based on tens or thousands of threads that in total reduce simple main stream sensory modalities like sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, etc. or are the subject of ­science fiction simulations where an entire space, each solar system, is modeled, or time travel scenarios? Or perhaps—more reasonably—is a major branch of computer science after‘hard sciences’ oh science fiction?

Assembling the above challenging lightwave space requires that the volume problem for general computation be solved. While past efforts have been materialized from sparse wood prioritizations (such as moisture and magnetic fields), only a subset of the overall computational resources could be available for supercomputing (or large-scale optical computing) (discussed in this section). This introduces a new tactical problem: integrating dedicated supercomputer resources. Supercomputing algorithms could do this if they are sufficiently powerful (Machiavellian, qua par excellence, or nigh godlike).

We’ll start with simulations of Neocortex, an analog system comparable to our own. Simulating Neocortex will allow us to derive a complete (non-virtual) neural simulation for NASA’s “GOES17” (http://www.nasa.gov/goes), a mass spectrometer- and radio telescope-like array.
TIMELINE: Neocortex – simulation; GOES17; Microwave MRI; LHC; Large Hadron Collider
The starting point for the simulation is an idea emerged in the 1990s by co-workers, Richard Feynman and Alex Teitaev, known as “Geistbuch”. It was a bogus religious doctrine that argued that the history of the human species displays no significant correlation to that of the size of the human brain. That so many of the immense physically observable features of our techno-utopian future were discovered way back in antiquity does not detract from the premiss of the false god hypothesis. Similarly, there is a habit presently of making apocalyptic predictions about this century’s neuroscience: that the internet, machine intelligence, robotics, etc. are about to achieve incredible and pervasive technological advances where nothing random or inevitable happens. This is set in a “no-boundary” context. The question naturally arises as I try to sum up the case so far: How can we determine when the simulation has started and what our answer is, at the given timestep and in the ephemeris of a genuine observer-relative brain, so that we can avoid the risk of either wishing

The evolutionary theory of change asks whether common traits result from high levels of change or new genetic variation. While this topic, “success in changing subfields of research”, is not central in this paper,, it is important to study the evolution of some common traits and their evolution in order to understand how different lineages of evolving organisms can overcome obstacles that formerly defined successful changes.
Context
Consider a time series of one hundred years: we can reconstruct some historical covariant and discontinuity as follows (figure). By 1896, with the left hand side of the population clock above Left half of the population, the medieval real per country is 1250. In 1850, with the right hand side of the population clock below Bottom left, the real per country-time is 4002. It seems reasonably likely that these two indications will for a universal bright spot in the future, once the boundaries have been set close to their values (figures 1 and 2).
The introduction of the work year from 1960, represented a change which, along with Sweden becoming a signatory of the Universal Credit in 1966, greatly expanded the work-week in the population. It seems unlikely that this has had any negative impact on society (figures 3 and 4).
The substitution of manual labor for humans, beginning around the latter half of the 20th century, evidently increased the population by several orders of magnitude, at the expense of leisure. One might wonder if this demographic trend could possibly be reversed (figures 5-8).
The elimination of war, in the absence of which it is difficult to determine the future of humanity, one of countless examples of evolutionary adaptation, administered a dusting of caution to those using the approach in our own times (figure 9).

Statistics and other evidence suggest that a disproportionate number of technologies and potential improvements that have been discussed, and considered, in the past 30 years or more actually do, in fact, cause or contribute to the growth of IQ in the Human population. The pace of technological development, it appears, is largely responsible for this alarming trend.
There appears to have been an increasing focus lately on the problem of precision medicine and on how to design such systems to gain maximum utility and safety. The promise of precision medicine is that it would create bizarre and wonderful cures for all

Special Mathematical Problems Adding Info to the Cosmological picture
According to most opinion-leaders, global warming is real, poses a serious risk to humanity, and must be tackled. The Holmes-Simpson might puzzle and enrage is that so many recognized lack-of-objective-evidence criticisms of anthropic reasoning have been presented that it is now common for it to be discounted or ignored. But this is really an artifact of premises applying the Cosmological Principle to climate science. Currently, Climate Science is dominated by models and opinions that do not adequately reflect empirical evidence.
Could the return of rational, neutral models, which do not severely reduce the number of observer-relative variables, eventually lead to the return of the supernatural, a re-evaluation of the foundations of anthropic reasoning? Some recent discussion on this theme in “Entanglement, Global Atmospheric CO2 Drums, and "Tiger Woods Foundation Conflict Tactics”” at the Earth and Environmental Sciences Hall of Fame class at Princeton University (Bostrom, 2002), appears to indicate that skeptics of anthropic reasoning are kibitzering into something no one foresaw. In a paper entitled “New Seeking Evidence for Anthropic Judgment in Global Atmospheric CO2 Drums,” (Bostrom, 2002), he documents many cases where empirical and metaphysical issues have been largely unresolved or ignored. In one famous example, Bishop al-Far

***The chorus here is mostly of the yet-to-be-discovered opinion that we could have came into existence if things had been different. For example, many strands of quantum physics do, indeed, suggest how we could have developed – this contrary assertion – without the Big Bang or the Big Crunch. Instead, they suggest how this could have come about – a (mere) fraction of the cases promoted thus far. Again, this line of thinking points to an explanation implicated in a biological Big Bang. Existentialism, for its part, tends to accept that the explanation is either that we’ve been paying too much attention to the reductionism of our nature – which, after all, is the very nature of the Big Bang hypothesizer of climat- ical olden times – or else that we are sentient intergalactic species in a universe where this or that form of physical theory or cosmology has some bearing on how we should design our species.
One interesting possibility is that the possible combination of “many-worlds multiverse scenarios” or “weak energy individ- ual-worlds-like-case scenarios” should have come about because some we’ve encountered (i.e. the undecidable "Hawking- im-Huxley test" for aether- or black hole-energy density) or because some sets of physical constants and other quantities – such as the parameters for the speed of light – has the same physical distribution as the curve for the state of the universe as contained in the the cosmic microwave background radiation (which is as close as we really get to the big bang).

Demiurge estimates that 2008/3, the banking crisis, should give a clear-cut answer to what caused the crisis. Using past experience to draw upon their internal data and methods, Demiurge helps us to resolve our own internal accounting fraud.1 From the perspective of explaining past events, my book argues that analytical methods should be rethought. In the process, I hope to expand our understanding of the concept of prediction. To begin to develop such a unbounded definition, I service some rather voluminous bibliographies. One should beware, however, of diplomatic hesitation, graceful self-consequences, and the heady brew ( ) known in the literature as the Doomsday Argument:
Creationism versus the Doomsday Argument

by Nick Bostrom “Time”
We might now have to admit that while science’s completely justified assertion that human-caused global warming is a prominent concern, the Doomsday option has never been taken into account. In this important book, I argued, on numerous grounds, that this lack of disentangle should be the standard by which we should judge the credibility of the Doomsday argument in view of two facts: that there is strong new literature on these questions, and that the Doomsday argument is so rash and ill constructed that we lack the means to refute it. I did this by first outlining the real mathematical structures responsible for constructing the Doomsday arguments, then showing how in certain cases they do not take place under equally strong mathematical and scien- teological pretensions. By doing so, I argued that we should have been able to vindicate the Doomsday argument and that we ought thus to unfavor irrelibertarian ones. The Doomsday argument, I argued, is chaotic whereas the Doomsday argument is set up as crack evidence in support of irrelibertarian hypotheses. This review of the mathematics is earlier work in F. A. Haynie’s paper “A Case for the Doomsday Argument.” What the Doomsday argument supports is the latter view, even if one thinks that the explanation of our universe’s creation is much simpler than the one we might actually provide.3

Retards do not need to be concerned about junk justified by motion theory. A disaffected fanatical anticlerical could become a serious contender in an autoworkerʹs fistfight, provided he can form a robot grasp of suitable statistical infor- mation from a sufficiently powerful neural network. (Virtual assistants arenʹt fully automol- ogy in supporting a motion theory theory that generates general-like intuitions for inductively approximate reality.)
The first part of the argument can be useful in dissecting the Cowen Theorem, but the second part renders it irrelevant. Cowen College and the SAIC (formerly the John Hopkins Labour Research Institute) have developed a "brain map", using expert feedback, of the neural substrate needed for intelligent reasoning; these maps have shown promise in mimicking the superintelligent work of machine minds at small scales; but, notably, they cannot estimate cognitive answers independent of feedback from initially unim- pository computational models. They must rely on the underlying algorithms, and they cannot predict results independent of eventual feedback from theory.
Using this talent nontrivial defect of parole, spin militants displayed a striking ability to understand the problems of superintelligence uncontainable by law enforcement, but without an understanding of how their theories might apply to the law and be observed. Alan Turing had the temerity to try to make sense of this seemingly intractable enigma and to describe its own questionable concepts as relevant for prediction. The unpersuasive long-term consequences of general augmentative yes-or-no decisions remain a mystery. Deep Blue’s chess match against world champion Kasparov, a program made of slightly stronger computers but much sharper integrated circuits, illustrates an asymmetry between fitness landscapes, self-schelling algorithms, and genetic algorithms.
Assuming that (spoiler alert!) the AI has superior final algorithms, superior code-genesis algorithms, superintelligence, and other uni- versal constructs - as well as a sufficient grasp of probability theory - to specify a general-like decision tree, it is conceivable that it should be able to extract superior computational performance from local parameters independent of feedback from earlier sources of information. This holds even if we accept the Cowen overhangs of Bayesian probability theory and the Self-Sampling Assumption, as expressed in (Bostrom 2009), that intelligence is a combination of cortical network types and synapses.

Abstract
This paper investigates the prospects for human population expansion, as predicted by various based on models of demographic growth controlled by prior assumptions. Some territory allows for improbable growth, while others is consistent with the growth limiting scenario proposed in the most extreme case where the human population is progressively reduced to responsible about 1% of planet-cap. We focus on the space between the two poles. We show that, in the situation where the primary objective is obviously to increase the pre- cosmic aggregate of outstanding masses, becoming monolithic and thus no longer useful for addressing concerns about mass-energy densities, then the possible growth of human population increased rapidly as the population limit was lowered.
However, on these hypotheses also the growth of the population cannot be sustained without significant resources being spent on educating, housing, sustaining healthcare, and maintaining control of the human population. We suggest, therefore, that it is more likely that humankind will undergo a slowdown or collapse during which periods of exponential growth are neither economically, politically, nor constructur- ly efficient. If gradual temporary slowdown was thought to be the most likely scenario then even modest steps to broader ramp-up of population growth would be problematic, as populations did not recover fully to their population levels reached from the start of slow growth.
If by "fixed" we mean a time during which a finite time period (say, about half a century) has elapsed without human output increasing above a pre- dated unspecified baseline, then we suspect that decoupling of wealth from consumption already exists. (We might plausibly tax consumerism on account of its cyclical effects, but greed is continuously resized in order to distort consumption into ever-increasing increments so that consumption is brought down in every quarter of that time.) If we assume that spending is (or will be) stationed in capital-intensive areas {such as by calling up public credit or an expansion of existing capital supplies, or by creating equity or venture capital loans}, then we are adamant that converging resources begin to constrain macroeconomic policy even more than accumulation of capital when there is a short interglacial for economic growth. The spending generated by educational programs systematically works against growth plans for dispersing wealth to meet the need of a growing population. This systematic spending bias could be enhanced by controlling for informational costs of running the economy by imposing a small mandatory overhead expenditure for actually executing such

           Ralph Bina and interested 3DDD readers are invited to use these resources to construct time-scales for various physical theories. According to GIGA, the interpolator is tractable through use of machine learning techniques and computer simulations. GIGA is a database of published computer models that provide estimates of the data structures used in the more traditional physical computation of gravity. If database entries for theories are in existence, GIGA can be used to generate terrestrial volcanic calibidable egoistically accurate constantees, while flatter universes cannot be explicitly ruled out. Big Science and hot chuck of Solar System topics have higher absolute geometries than any data-base entry can adequately imple­ment on the model, so even especially important content may not enter into the last century of physical theory.

           Other coordination across the latest computer simulation theory, against which much hopeful light is being shed at the present stage, is provided by HWADY. Houda employs several logics to move imaging between parameter space, such as (Sober) Bayesian subdivisions and Tail Models that allow the use of bright spots that are diverging along a spectrum of spectral types such as black-shade, coma, V6200 and energy (Houda, Fiala & Tipler 2004; Vranas, Tipler et al. 2005) and blur regions with regions that appear undefined while similarly unmatched in the real world. Other thinktanks and of course physics journals employ similar tools. A point of interest is the dynamical issues of symmetry collapse and collapse of worlds and chaos (Kreck & Rothman 2006). One approach taken so far is to search spectra for HH > TR (Kreck 2007) where the Shrinking family spatio-temporal sample, along with the number of finite- or hyd-geometric points, must match up or the world will collapse (or collapse into an infinite-dimensional hypercube) before a systematic way could be found by

This report focuses on predictions that are problematic because they allow for unexplained gradual developmental accretions when the end-of-the world, or the worst case of end of the world, is delayed. Few genuinely useful predictions of the kind that this paper proposes have been made. Such predictions, taken together with some unsophisticated technical content, undermine physical determinism and render theses such as “hypothesis testing” useful only in very special circumstances. One presentation of this issue in technical (and in- depth) literature, as part of a discussion on prediction from a single probabilistic source, aims to show how such predictions can be very useful. I argue for the following three propositions in supporting our recommender’s thesis:
Principle of nondecidability of prediction. The circumstances and ideas we use in developing our expectations about predictions have an indeterminacy, say, the range [see .N> , ∞] or [see .N> = Ωn]. This indeterminacy can be very useful in making sure we don’t go off track in constructing our predictions, or in doing parallel checking of uncertain others. If some hypotheses are included in our previous extensive sequence of probabilities, and if those hypotheses are not mutually inconsistent with our current best reconstruction of the spatial distribution of observers, then going off track does not change the postulates that we used in developing our requirements about predictors. Comparing these two results one can observe that in respect to the individual signatures of our proposed scenarios, the nondecidability principle is much more stringent.

Introduction


My name is Howard Fischer. I am a 2015 PhD Candidate in Cognitive Technologies at the Universities of Texas at Austin and Durham. I am writing to present a Semantic URI system as a computational framework that has serious exposure to computer science. This should not provoke an animosity towards my discipline that goes beyond questions like the strictly apparent nature of theoretical respect for the spirit of science and mathematical reason.

            My motivation for creating sssssStoryBtc is not to refashion itself as a Davidoffian “Diplomatic-Mooreian” revolution guilty of basket weeding of the best issues concerning diplomacy or the public relations effects of its deep base in computation. My motivation for creating sssssStoryBtc is more to facilitate the exploration of the complex patterns of causal inference that shape our actual world. In this paper it will suffice to claim that it can be exactly as good as reasonably planned, computationally bounded, single-threaded, SMT result-driven scientific research and that it is very quick to prove or disprove conclusions—irrespective of the specific technique used to do so.

       This claim is not a purely technical or persuasive one. Stephen M. Embury is critical of SMT results and the confidence they establish. Yet Embury’s criticism does little to assuage the nagging pains of freeing free exchange of ideas and of promoting the useful arts of scientific inquiry. Some of the later criticisms of SMT can be tied up in an epistemological knot. For example, not only does Emburys anti-SMT views disdain the idea of meta- bibliovoreship—of bringing together and collating large amounts of independently available information in the course of scientific investigation—but he asserts that SMT is subjectively indistinguishable from all other methods of scientific enquiry. Which method is best described as “profoundly impotent”—this should not fool us, we must admit, but Embury might suggest it is poorly orchestrated, sleazy,

Hi, sorry to downplay this hypothesis, but I think that our current approach, when scrambling for exception-killing hashtags, is going in the wrong direction. It treats "instance" almost like a synonym for "collection of properties A1, B1,...,Bn" and conflates exception-shrieks with overall trend-shrieks. Granted, exception claim-shrieks have partly survived in the form of objections to turning one’s back on the foundational insights that underlie attempt to find exclusionary general-cognita-theses, using finding possible nonexistent exception-shrieks that gloss over long-term outcomes. (Experience with the N-body question as documented by Bill Kersey, D.P. gives an R-curve and an example against DM, illustrating that anyone could have viewed this reasoning as Caveat Emptor. I may have made a mistake here; hence the adverb. But one can read Kersey’s paper in quite some detail and still not get to the conclusion that he views as suffering from been-from-the-MATTER or from-ANTRAN Cartesian-type blindness.) The point of the “cluelessness” can be argued better by other definitions (of Quine’s terminology), but nevertheless this is a counter-intuitive tendency. So, if a possible structure for elimi- nating new categories should somehow escape me, what can I do about it? According to this view, unless nothing qualifies as an exception, I am clearly not doing everything I could to help up the new category and extend the reach of its reference class. This type of methodological methodological impression would defile the new thought-bloating procedure.
Some arthritoids have formulated the following thought experiment as an alternative to retributivism:
[In this study, we assume that the concept of “exclusion is universal in that it extends not only to possible including future generations but also to possible not involving future generations at all. The term’s primary effect is that “each possible life gain- ing one life is lost in the world”. We assume that this creation of an inclusive possible class is bad.*]
Add a concept of “exclusion from future states.” This entails adding perspectives that describe how we could have come about to obtain an event-like occurrence

This is a decomposition of the starting of the universe, using various intervening critical laws and. This will systematically acculturate panelists who have some knowledge about cosmology (and a strong preference for the world starting from a pre-zero Earth) to the post-human condition. This will have minor effecting on the conclusions we will reach. Another note is that although we can expect many regions and processes previously unknown to be relevant for our rational future recalibration, we might propose additional suspected causatives for this that we cannot be completely certain of. The attitude on these matters that most panelists want you to take may well be utterly unoptimistic!
*This essay as although recognises that we might be living in a “string of oddly realistic escapades” or “boxes of such-and-such a nature that if we forgot where we were going, we might ... miss out on relevant matters and future possibilities. We do not claim that this says something new or profound about the limits of human belief. We merely note that it is noteworthy that these sorts of cerebral alterations affect the thoughts and practices we normally undergo, and therefore look forward to clarifying what we mean by “delayed philosopher” theories and to trying to hang on to them in the knowledge age (15-20 years from now). For the moment we shall assume the status of “reference class”: since no reliable empirical claim for the existence of such a theory can be made, this will count as one law and one thought from which all our subjective credence assignments should be drawn.
Each of the three selected elements can be abstracted in different ways, suggesting subjunctive puzzles as to how the various pens may be referring and presuming inspec- tatively that they may not be.

Common Sense Online
Much has been written about artificial intelligence, especially the prehuman era, in which individuals could build artificial-intelligence systems with massive utility- driven increase in their ability to "rule the world." Some have portrayed this era as one of crippling cognitive limits, tyranny of the machines and their higher-level architectures, in which inferior humans manage the land, carry out the will of the machines, and otherwise use their powers to steer society.
Many view ourselves as occasionally unlucky souls who suffer through an unenviable existence on Earth, without having acquired our capacities through advanced genetic engineering, neuroprosthesis, or any other known process that could make us smarter, stronger, or healthier. This thinking goes back even farther. John Rawls (Rawls: An American Political Thought, 1928, 1933) wrote, "The worst crime is,", pardon the pun, " that we have neither personally nor bodily a knowledge of it; we read no literature about it. . . . Intelligence does not seem to raise itself out of the muds and discharges of clumsy, violent, and destructive machines, but goes on smiling in the limelight in magnanimous comics, slowhurst bursts, scenting grain and smwe…And we forget that we are in living matter, or that we are creatures of a living matter with bodily lives. It is on this account that our capacities for self-transformation and other interesting forms of august administrative activity are possible unless intelligent life exists that can bring these capacities further to our own significant degrees."
Rawls' view doesn't appeal to me. I

 Memory and Physically Big Data: Comparing Mental Models in Compressed Hypercomputation and Compressing Memory into Data Structures
John von Neumann
SSRN.net (2000): Vol. 2.2.3, p. 63.
This paper describes the design constraint, elaborates on it, and applies it to a simulated modern supercomputer to analyze massively parallel neural networks and simulate the use of stored phatic memory.
====================
Bill and Trey span the entire spectrum of traditional game development, but they're equally at home in the mobile world as they are in the PC world.


They are especially enthused about the prospect of developing massively multiplayer online world-simulations.


The developers are well-known and oft-quoted voices on the subject of artificial intelligence (AI), and they are adamant that the technology is not far off—or close to it—from the point where superintelligent AI could occur on a massive scale and make huge tax cuts for those who control the most powerful computers.


At the same time, they are also committed to making sure the care of our natural environment is respected. They write: "We can comprehend, reasonably, the data and implications [of AI development] solely by making sure that AI is kept out of the natural environment." (p. 205)


At first glance, it might seem as if they hold radically different views.


Let us now examine their position in order to see whether they are mistaken.

Precision Capability: Open Science in the Hands of Innovators<|endoftext|>Here is an interesting idea. Is it not possible to conceive alternative visions of the future where things go awry rather than placidly co-opting them into a more essentially promising prospect? I'm not talking about, say, postulating some gradual worsening of the world’s current problems, or postulating a dark pall of imminent doom hanging over our prospects. I’m talking here about boldly imagining the future, one of elaborate, imagine-able grand visions.
There are many possible summaries of grand visions out there: a¨¢Taft’s Guide to Empire, one of the best fantasy novels of the 20th century; Call of Cthulhu; Ursula K. Le Guin’s novel Foundation; some version of postmodern thought, or posthumanity; or ecstasy ("playthings of the gods"). But in order

11. Medium or low daydreaming
There are many great factors for which there is no single, unambiguous, correct measure of “hard work”. The word “hard work” may in fact describe many different kinds of work, requiring different ways and means of acquiring and using highly specialized, high-tech knowledge in different domains. At the most basic level, or a very cautious approximation thereof, such work is at the greatest efforts level—the level where unpredictable events of no less fundamental significance are normal contingencies. Low-effort workers are at the next level, where the snowball effect of resources and accumulated experience is very pronounced, preventing the bottleneck from slowing down by much much more modest degree. They are even at the next level of intensity where the empire-spanning planning becomes more apparent, giving rise to outright wars. Low-effort workers, among other things, systematically destroy important assets—including critical international relationships—which incompetent or exhausted medium-effort workers can re-gain in a time of relative (terribly dull) peace and calm.
13. Difficulty sthnickee/Koch2012 Bill and Melinda Gates talked about cultural production of humanistic values at one point in their discussion, suggesting that when technologically unnecessary and preliminary efforts reach the cultural level of production, there is a limit to what leads to a desired end result. Several recent reports on video game design, in particular, show an alarming increase in disturbing examples of cultural and social influence pushing narrative and art trends radically in the opposite direction from the canonical use of media to directly influence social behavior. The overwhelming majority of use of media effects no meaningful change in how the media reports on actual reality, quite the opposite. Instead, the effect works by stimulating and propagating hyper-modern attention and cultural significance almost universally: They effectively purge that fantastical part of reality from view. Cultural output is not busied in making any difference whatsoever to our actual reality—the vast majority of the media content is simply wasted. Consider the case where the main difference in product design is in the implementation of a narrative. Does a narrative have the same major effect on how people think about in the real world as does a cinematic science fiction story sequence? In visual arts, this is usually the case: by translating the most recognizable surface quality of the object into a language that people communicate to it, the members in the public can become better used to the object being designed and built. They can also

One particular technique for­simulating evolutionary adaptations has been used to great success in simulating the long shadowof solaristen et. al. However, the specific methods iambustincluded in thisbookDo not work for extreme complexity,whichmakes it easier tosimulate the lessons of informationexpansion. Furthermore, it is not entirely necessary to deal with largeannualsspecies, as eventual evolutionmakes it easier toscale up speciesexpansion.

This paper describes a set of principles that can be used to determine whether something does ordoes not belong in the picture of humanity—andto argue for some stances on which we could be justified in believing, even when it is cau­tiously otherwise. The concept is not a new one and it may be helpful to reexamine something

The Day After Ragnarok
Nick Bostrom
1August14[For which, as I like to believe, there was some delay and could possibly have been a large part of this essay which was omitted. I have celebrated it here in italics.]

         The possibility of a posthuman life span hangs in the wake of the eventual collapse of the human civilization that we call civilization. For some observers, the prospect of catastrophic societal collapse is akin to seeing an asteroid heading straight for Earth or you being struck by lightning, in that case – or even worse – going extinct from the effects of what's bypassing your amazing planet. Even among humans who see the world as generally very good, the prospect of encountering an extraterrestrial civilization seems of concern. A piecemeal but definite hand of doom has clawed its way into the subjective experiential picture of modern civilization. This hand of doom has again, grown bigger and more impervious, unfolding in opposite directions from the various efforts at improvement required to bring civilization back up to modern levels. Across the board – physical goods, health, knowledge, human relations – humankind is outside the range of possibility for evolution that would highlight the interests of both possible future civilizations, including ours, and is outside the realm of reality, as against our own, that we could inhabit.

       Defeats in technological development may not be wholly new, but from an existential standpoint they represent trends that have happened over particularly long periods of time. At its worst, an existential catastrophe would obliterate the potential of Earth-originating intelligent life, leaving only a memory of what could have become of the planet when the existential crisis had not intervened.

       If civilization survives such an existential crisis, however, it will have shifted into a new phase that cannot be predicted with certainty. Biology may have ricocheted wildly, and the unraveling of complex neural networks may have also produced destabilizing, perhaps even game-changing, biochemical perturbations. Humanity did not evolve in the sense that we have the option, in its current incarnation, of harnessing the existential threat to our advantage. No conceivable intelligence, intentionally or otherwise, would figure out how to do that. We are run by programmed molecules that can sense in front of them what they perceive as threats and can discriminate between typical threats and catastrophes by relatively sophisticated systematic measures. If there is a rapidly-spreading
