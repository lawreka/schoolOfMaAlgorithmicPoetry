    <div class="q">
        Finding your metaphor<br />
        How do you write?<br />
        What do you want to research?<br />
        What does writing means to you and how can you describe your writing experience?<br />
        What does your writing practice mean to you?<br />
        For those who already write code, you can try to think about it in your own coding practice

<div class="a">
To me, writing is a magical art. Writing is a form of alchemy, or transmutation - the transmutation of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/">qualia</a> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality">consensus reality.</a><br/>
<br />
Bringing something into being for others that only exists in our own ephemeral, subjective perceptions is a form of magic. The author conjures the sensation of biting into a crisp, juicy apple by arranging words and if they are a skilled enough illusionist, the reader can feel its skin against their own teeth. Poetry is a particularly potent form of conjuration, able to invoke entire worlds and lives of experience with minimal verbiage.<br/>
<br />
Writing code is a kind of magic that allows us to commune with unseen forces that although deterministic are also somewhat mystical - crystal clocks and hovering magnetic plates inside of machines humming with invisible electronic energy. And with regards to artificial intelligence, I find it fascinating to try to use the exchange of language via writing human-code (written words) and programming language to explore the potential for machine qualia, and the dialogue between us and all of the electrical energy of the universe - not just that which we harness via computing.</div>

    <div class="q">
        Can you make the <a href="week2-lovelettergenerator.html">love letter generator</a> be more human?<br />

        What kind of topics would be relevant?<br />
        How does the work change by modifying the complexity of its processes?<br />
        What does the texts gain from that action?<br />

<div class="a">
I wanted to give the love letter generator a modern twist. Instead of chaste love letters to "darling duck" etc., these are the sort of communications you can expect from your lover in the 21st century. (It's a <a href="week2-sextgenerator.html">sext generator</a>).<br/>
<br />
I changed the word database to a be predominantly emojis and some suggestive openers like "u up?" and signoffs that include "jk... unless ur into that". The sext machine generates three messages: an opening text chosen from the list of openers, a suggestive "i want" statement consisting mainly of emojis and an optional bridging statement between them like "in ur", and a signoff expressing the sender's current emotion: love, lust, embarrassment, or trepidation.<br/>
<br/>
The selection of emojis consists of many (like üçë and üçÜ) that are already used in a sexual way, and many that are not particularly sexualized (like üöó, üî®, and üçó). This mixture often makes the output a bit absurd. Some of my favorite mixed message sets were:<br/>
<br/>
hey üòè<br/>
id luv 2 üíã all over ur üß† <br/>
üíï ü§™ üòù<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
u up?<br/>
what would you do if i ü©∏ üî™ <br/>
üò≥ üò¨ üò¨<br/>
<br/>
I tweaked the CSS from the original to make it look like receiving text messages, and changed the interface so that you receive one set of 3 messages per click of the "click 2 sext" button instead of the endless generation in the original M.U.C. example. For sexts in particular, I thought it's better if the reader has some agency about when they're going to see them. An endless stream of sexts, even if these ones aren't all explicit, could be distressing, and this way the funny ones are easier to save since they won't be moving or disappearing until you generate a new one.

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <div class="q">
        Can you write a program that says Hello World? What would you think is more relevant to try for beginners? Search for other Hello World examples? Bring a small anthology<br />
        Can you think of a use for non executable code? Have you found any element in your code or others' code that may have cultural significance?<br />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="a">
    This week, I took the "hello world" prompt in a different direction, thinking about the larger natural/universal implications of that statement, and writing code as worldbuilding. The idea of non-executable code also made me think of parts of writing code that as engineers we may find annoying or deem "non-essential," which fall under the banner of accessibility. Making web pages accessible and navigable by screenreaders is often an afterthought that I wanted to bring to the fore with this assignment.<br>
    <br>
    I used VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader appliation for Mac, to read my poem which is printed in white text on a white screen. The text refers to the wonder of the natural world and how we navigate it with different senses. You can <a href="week3-helloworld.html">visit the poem here</a> or listen to it being read by VoiceOver below.

    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <div class="q">
        Imagine a speculative scenario along the lines of Stanislaw Lem's work<br />
        Curate text using LSTM, GPT-2 or Talk to Transformer<br />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="a">
    In the week between the last two classes, we read A History of Bitic Literature from Stanis≈Çaw Lem's "Imaginary Magnitude". In this review of imagined texts from the future written and co-written by AI authors, Lem describes four peaks of bitic literature. The first is "monoetics/homotropia", in which computers replicate human use of language based on the building blocks that they discern from our usages - very much like what RNNs, LSTMs, and Markov chains do now. They also produce their own neologisms, and unexpected interplays of language, similar to what we see in <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/">AI Weirdness</a>: 
    <quote>
        "The unintentional humor arises from a collision of categories which we consider to be permanently separate; the reinforcement of programs by categorial principles carries us into the next sphere of bitistics (though still called prebitistics by some researchers), in which machines begin to unmask our language, tracking down in it turns of speech which are the consequence of man's bodily structure."
    </quote>
    The second phase is deemed "mimesis/exact mimesis" and describes programs which learn to write in the exact style of a human author, able to continue their works in translation and posthumously. I found it interesting what Lem says here about "filling in the gaps" of their work:
    <quote>
    "If, however, he has left something "unsaid" (e.g., for biological reasons, because he died prematurely, or for social ones, because he did not dare to), mimesis can produce the missing links. To be sure, the final success will also be decided by the topology of a given writer's sematures; in this regard we differentiate between divergent and convergent sematures."
    </quote>
    With regards to poetry, what is left unsaid or the "gaps" may be the entire point! But perhaps Lem's AI have also taken that into consideration.<br>
    <br>
    The third is "sophocrises/critique of philosophy" which is a transitional zone between human and posthuman literature, in which humans read and critique machine literature, and machines read and critique human literature. And the fourth phase, "apostasy/bitic creation" describes works created by and for machines, which are completely inscrutable to humanity.<br>
    <br>
    In my work this week I wanted to take the concept of the third phase, in which humans and machines critique each others' philosphy, by taking the writing of <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/">Nick Bostrom</a> as my GPT-2 fodder. Bostrom is an Oxford philosophy professor known for his writing on AI ethics, transhumanism, the simulation theory, and other futurist topics. I manually copied the text out of all the PDFs available on his site, producing a 4 MB text file to train on. Then, using <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple/">gpt-2-simple</a> on <a href="https://spell.ml/">spell.ml</a>, I produced many text samples of moderate temperature (1.0) where I could see that the subject matter was clearly influenced by Bostrom's writing (with many references to the nature of the universe, singularities and the Doomsday Argument in particular), but it had strayed far enough away from repitition that there were also many unexpected phrases.<br>
    <br>
    To create these poems, I actually printed the text samples, putting aside the thought that I personally was deforesting the Amazon rainforests, and took a highlighter to them. Reading AI-generated text can be a bizarre, meandering process, but I felt that approaching the texts this way was particularly bitic. Using a sort of cut-up method, I highlighted interesting or poignant phrases and then reassembled them into poetry. To present them, I have retained the entire text of the sample as a sort of background texture, and overlayed the final poems on top:<br>
