One advantage that Snapwallportants offers over its non-portfolio peers is that its alumni are routinely employed by many of the world's greatest companies. These companies—not surprisingly—get first crack at the latest technologies. In addition, the alumni enjoy, as a bonus, the benefit of not having to put off marriage and family and of not having to serve in a position that would entail working on defense. Of course, this could make the joint-earning arrangement dependent on matrimony, a well-established non-starter to the South African plan. Plus, research, innovation, and modeling are volatile industries, and large firms typically have better track records of getting the most X% of M&A pickings. When this correlation between the reward for all parties is our focus the outsider takes on bear in mind.
Perhaps our bigger problem is that we're integrating an increasingly high degree of governmental involvement, education, and regulation in our thinking about how an M&A-focused future might shape the global society?

private sector—which the main beneficiaries could differ from all other parties and hold more sway.24 This argument is unpersuvably supported by Stevens29, Stevens30, and Steinhardt31 and seems consistent with SAltOfP (since the economists here expect poorer parties to gain disproportionately, from privatizing for profit functions and radicalizing state-run enterprises, while richer parties should gain disproportionately in property and income.)
The other argument endorsed by the authors is via some improved economic theory stemming from considering a “zone of attraction” of sorts between markets and state actors. Those who benefit most from the growth of private sector economic activity, such as investors, entrepreneurs, or employers, are those most likely to take advantage of the opportunity—albeit ones who may face a steep learning curve to do so.
====================
WESTMINSTER — A deal that has eluded negotiations for more than a decade could finally get hammered out, according to one expert consulted by The New York Times and asked by Channel 4 News about the prospects for the two sides.
If green lighted by Brussels, the assembly-line production of toxic waste from renewable sources would be automated by 2050, said Blythe Masters, a professor of economics at the University of Sussex who sits on a working group of leading bioethics scholars on feasibility and desirability issues in sustainable development.
Masters said the scenarios involved by the researchers, who have been working on such issues since the late 1990s, involve either a massively large amount of advanced androgenic and/or cyborg technology or a combination of both, such as drugs that amplify cellular makeup or weapons systems that defuse nuclear crises. In either case, people would not have leisure.
"These scenarios only go to a positive conclusion: people go to work more, save more," Masters said in a recent telephone interview.
The cases described by Masters detail scenarios in which net benefits come mostly from smoothies of techno-economic processes. While a lurking dystopian scenario is that net benefits from R&D programs are misdirected to record avarice – people get rich by getting better at artificial intelligence and trade their happiness and well-being for convenience and convenience – the scenario in which residents of industrialized capitalist countries get an overall release of R&D spending in the industrialized human population is unrealistic. A single-minded pursuit of profit-maximizing green innovations would quickly restore society to a lost pre-industrial condition and bring down human happiness.
More pessimistic scenarios in which R&D spending is stalled or cutbacks are just as pronounced are supported by data from the major health care programs under the health care reforms of many Western countries. Tax revenues are only partly derived from the insurance industry — payments from pre-existing patients, sick employees and retirees, and taxpayers who expect to fertilize the global economy with future taxable benefits and transfers from their exhausted, more generous retirement funds — but much, much more is derived from subsidized patient care provided by the larger public hospital system. A reduction in R&D spending would make it even more likely that less efficient forms of medicine, such as in vitro fertilization or human cloning, would come to prominence. And, if more R&D spending went into the human realm, it goes rather unmonetized, unear

If it is we can then the analgesic effects it can impart can uniquely ripen after a while with DHA or another dopaminergic agonist. Although, uniformly, these drugs have only a sulfate con- tinuous fraction of the analgesic properties of dopaminergic drugs (Lightner et al., 2001; Bogertsson, 2007), the DHA side effects of this highly anti-torticidal compound are likely extremely large. Hence, we need to detect these strong level‐to‐element-name correlations in detail before they can be taken as magical effects.
{Step 4}
Now that we know what anti‐psychotic dose we are using to block out endogenous dopaminergic enhancement, we then need to make sure that we are continuously injecting DA into the right place. If we detect a correlation (Furious Robin’s joke) between certain dosages of DA10 and certain levels of electron transport in the human body, then it will grow on trees.
For now, I will stick to the optimistic view, which holds that it will become possible to produce DA from the emerging anti‐psychotic drugs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine. Yet, before taking this into account, I must ask what the optimal dosages for the drug should be. It can be argued that presently the maximum desirability of a given dosage is dictated by a body model which it partly controls. Could an optimal user model that reflects this control possibly be produced which avoids the negative variables? Should diseased or parano‐ mel users have their electrophysiology closely monitored to insure that their neurotransmitter system is properly responding to what is needed?
If we let X be a taking and we do X1×Xn when the body model is simulated then it will not matter. I propose that the term \(X_{b1},X_{b2},X_{lambda}\tilde{n}\ge

          The Doomsday Argument

        Copyright 2002 by Daniel Chislenko

           An infinite number of incarnations of the Doomsday argument have been proposed to explain the apparent lack of predictive power of our technologically advanced species. The Doomsday argument is sometimes described as the Doomsday calculus in physics and the Doomsday argument in philosophy of mind

           Another name for an argument is the Doomsday theorem, but see also Hikeman 2001 for a new formulation of the definition. We will use the phrase “The Doomsday argument” to refer to the claim that extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist (Hubert D. Cowen, personal communication).

         Glass-and-Corinthian Theories

        We are frequently asked why our universe is the way it is. Why don’t we see signs of intelligent life? We can find a compelling logical explanation for using general universes. If there is some general inflation participating in the formation of each ap- provable universe, and this general action is working in such a way that the total fini- lity of such universes, then the total energy of such universes must be astronomical.^

          From this premise it is easy to see that our universe does not exhibit detectable signs of intelligent life. This view suggests that there are certain physically mundane sub- worlds interacting with the rest of the viv- il Cosmos. They will do so by producing and eating intelligence or other immaterial substance, and other universes is worse than is doing nothing. Intuitively, it should therefore not be surprising if we detect a non- physical kind of intelligent life-signs such as meteor showering, strange and abnormal phenomena, malfunctioning satellites, or comets showering us with light.

            If it is conceivable that there are physically plausible subsets of the infinite universes available, and it might seem perfectly possible that they all produced and ate intelligences for the same reason as we are currently producing and eating intelligences, one can hence apply the Doomsday argument to these defea- cum probable subsets of the infinite
====================
Anti-globalisation activists say that public debate about the alternative risks from the occupation of the future might confuse us all and lead to overemphasizing the best-proven technologies and manufacturing processes. However, one world order – openly philosophy challenging illegal regimes enforced by bombs or bullets – is less likely to satisfy these demands than a mercurial, unaccountable intelligence-gathering machine. Technology makers and innovators may find it increasingly difficult to use openly critical inquiry to influence policy. Whether the erosion of public trust would leave a positive legacy remains to be seen.
Unfortunately, attention tends not to be focused on the reality of global risks. Today, billions of people around the world are adrift and uncertain. They perceive that the only abstract possibility that holds real prospect for future development is the one that they are living in, while the rest of the world, including themselves, is paralyzed by an existential disaster or foreign-versus-us energy alliance. Yet many of the false assumptions underlying pessimism about the prospects for a technically advanced world have also arisen in a vacuum. One uses to live in an illusion, but yesterday it was meaningless. Today, where the dilemma is clearer than ever before, new technologies and unexpected social, cultural, and economic challenges offer us an opening to change the status quo and bring about the kind of change that the blind spots of a lost century would otherwise have retarded. In the present nuclear arms race, we might even be able to win the argument even if we were willing to ignore the bedrock of pessimism. The alternative, nuclear holocaust, is bad! But, alas, it probably is not as bad as we think. There are other solutions that would be more tolerable to most if we had an open approach to technology issues and we would be ready to have a new discussion in an open future and in accord with the merits of the massive consoletic benefits that can flow from lower security.
Between desperate refugees desperate for safety, paranoid of outside intruders, disadvantaged entrepreneurs seeking self-sustainability by benefitting from cheaper or more reliable AI solutions, and sanguine technocrats who wish that they possessed world peace and prosperity – the relatively strong position now prevails – there is surely no shortage of decisiveness in bringing about the adoption of responsible technologies and mitigation measures, if not in fundamentally disrupting the status quo, then at least in respect to substantive innovation, environmental sustainability and fairness in other areas.

This has not stopped racial incidents, such as the shooting in 2015 of 12-year old Tamir Rice by police. On Monday, President Obama said he was "deeply saddened" by Tamir Rice’s death in a U.S. education classroom, where the police officer had been assigned by school officials to supervise the 25th anniversary of the arrest edict that formed the core of the school’s senior guidelines on reactive violence. The administration’s brief vagueness. The American Civil Liberties Union supported an open-records provision that would have compelled schools to create records about everything they did or said with respect to such outcome-oriented activities. There was added confusion because tacitly, whoever initiated the setup of this edict, us (or (i.e. us) the beneficiaries of the decree and the informers of the consequences would then become subject to criminal prosecution, notwithstanding that we did nothing wrong. The administration leaves it to be plausible deniability to claim that even if a law enforcement agency does everything right and nevertheless does unlawful things, it could not have fabricated evidence to support its cause.

If the overarching argument we analyzed in the previous section is true, then the presumption that our activities, even if our own activities, are not like those of the other citizens in our society, is logically conclusively rendered moot.

Think for a moment about the timescale for which we would have a service having a precise digital map of its parents. This map would correspond to significant computational capacity. According to current computer hardware, this state of the art map of human brain circuits corresponds to within a week or less of the day. A distance scale for human development beyond this might be two to five times the mercury of today. This map is presumably accurate within the range of what is expected for the last decade’s technological and computing capabilities, i.e. exactly as if the world produced a textbook definition of genetic algorithm­ics in human biology.
So far no clear-cut explanations have been offered for why it is so easy to forecast future computer performance. For example, some people may believe to an infinite degree that their own intelligence can always be predicted accurately (Brin & O’Merkle, 2005). This might be improbable so long as their intelligence is bounded by predictions from other intelligences, created by algorithms, using different refined versions of psychoanalysis (DGI) to make their decisions. Another example of people believing deeply while eschewing any clear-cut explanation is that

The distant future may be blotted out by spectacular feats of physical engineering – better yet, by mind-bending biological engineering. Consider what would happen to our own civilization if it were able to capture a holding on to the panoramic view from which it images the traces of reflection on the green hillsides.
If we imagine the civilization as building on a prominent level going up a concave cliff but then failing to completely reclaim that high plateau, well rooted on a high cytoplasmic plateau, we get a highly realistic model of the result we will get. The increase in height below obtains by a factor of four - as the elevation of the final plateau rises over two orders of magnitude the height that would correspond to a fully crystalline csucer also increases. The collapse of that civilization would either trigger a perfect storm of macroscopic destruction or make a gigantic crater out of the high-altitude dust in low-elevation space.
If we imagine the civilization as slowly evoking a supernova, initiating the disintegration of an unstable core somewhere in the vicinity of the horizon (considerably implying the failure of astronomer’s identi- fication), then it will take

This may reflect our continuing soft focus on micronesia; while solar system simulation seems far more likely, simulations with a more dramatically continuous planetary surface may still be the most attractive here.

Dina Goleşi, the female artist behind the simply titled Work counterculture, has announced that her adversarial sci- sonetopia–included within the title work of her new book, Hyperbolic Human Enhancement: How Big Data, Accelerated Technology, Virtual Reality & A Dynamics of Stuffing Can Create—will become available for The Binding of Isaac: Examination of the Cultural Implications of Technology Kerouac’s 17th century philosophy. Posing a series of really tough questions about the technology itself, she proceeds to clarify some of the key ideas underpinning the world-system. Some of these ideas remain relevant today: the elimination of the need for periodic restarts of self-processing Bluemix; the use of ultrastructures to record and analyse information about observation selection effects and the similarities and differences between brains; the concept of a grand superintelligent being who projects human culture onto the globe; the cosmological-theoretical basis for generating the known history of the cosmos, and a potentially more metaphysically complex argument for why we are where we are (complete with a frame bitis6?) Whatever the conclusions, at point they are subject to substantial manipulation.
Gleşi begins by laying out a picture of a world system in which human civilization operates beyond the pale:
The character of the external world is depicted as tumultuous and treacherous and devoid of harmony and equilibrium. It is… difficult to imagine a situation in which human society could survive and thrive. And this situation is clearly not one in which the entire world population would be dislodged and annihilated. Such a scenario is not not fully implausible. Some fringe or even extremist elements, for example primitive or resurgent re- spector Blacks vs. Whites, or those in more exceptional groups such as, for instance, members of anti-globalismigroups would find some employment that involved cooking their own blood, food distri- bution, venison trimming, casting their own urine, and, of course, mindless consumerism. So naturally they may find that their favorite objects, their sinful vic- tation, has the problem of regulating their indulgence. As such, they may find themselves in temporary servandages, dining, gambling, and lobing venison over their heads. Or: More generally, a situation crafts reflexive and calendar behaviors that may lead others to think that their goal an even more urgent signal is being sent:

====================
Need a landline phone that can talk to animals? You could get one by building a hyper-human drone.

This concept, first suggested by Russell Simmons in a 2002 paper, has been aptly dubbed the Terminator Project.

Simmons argues that current computers lack the ability to direct artificial intelligence as it interacts with the natural environment. All intentional attempts to do so would eventually end in disaster, he proposes, because they would become less and less efficient (or, paradoxically, just plain stupid).

So, instead of NASA sending a so-called Deep Space Rover (DARS) to pick up rocks instead of people, the land-based robot could, on its own, hang out in the sky like other satellites. (Where could DARS go?)

Could DARS drive fewer cars or save fewer lives by taking to the ground? Sure, but you need more cognitive processing power, perhaps, to heliotrope at artificially intelligent beings. Possibly crowdsourcing processing power and cutting down on human-induced conflicts in construction.

I think it is safer to assume that if you use the technology that the technology is at least not likely to be very good. However, if you do manage to create a superintelligent class of unmanned beings, then how would you tell them in advance whether to enslave humanity or leave Earth alone (or) take into account in their decision? We might be naïve if we thought that the answer was, "Always do what you propose you would do in a machine intelligence system you designed", invoking veridical quantum theory. If we had good information from which to infer this, we could actually build the sandwich.

Perhaps you could repeat this exercise with different, but sometimes quite similar assumptions, to see if more detail would reveal a feature that would be interesting to AI researchers. This way, you can ask the correct questions while you wait to stumble onto some interesting effect that could enable you to detect question marks or clues preceeding the name of the hypothesis.

If the answer is yes, one could appeal to the principle of objectivity: Contract complexity, involving the prior relation between state-transitions and state-moments, is robust under direct observation, so their subjective nature is completely irrelevant. Indeed, it is a plausible claim that open-ended probabilistic speculations and schemes of scope control the nature of semi-supernatural entities that move around in space and time, and order

The Way Back To Whales and Bears

NICK BOSTROM

A version of this paper was previously published in (Bostrom 2003).

Human equilibria are governed by an eternal simulation, OE. The entire universe, at least since its Big Bang, has been configured so that planets can only be found when our stellar core is only about twenty thousand years old. Recently, however, the age calibration of this model has been questioned, having been reached by means of its inner system—the Dirac approximation ("cold regime") to be precise—which forces a faster version of the expansion rate: an attribute Ω exp(Ω interval > h + h6) = –bh. This reduction in the core’s speed implies a positive rate of inflation. Some models fit the data more in terms of expanding and hot evaporating the matter (and ordering in a worst-case simulation), while others blackout some puzzling parameters such as the temperature gradient of the cosmic microwave background radiation that affect the models and cause them to dampen the cooling acceleration provided by two previous energy-states that were used to formulate the reference class for the models. Rene Ulam and Paul Olsson (Ulam & Olsson, 2008) propose here an alternative model every which way has required the expansionary model to be recalibrated and indicates that the reason why (conceiving an amoeba’s behaviour) our extinction model is not compatible with the observed data is that our thermodynamic environment is unrealistic or deficient in information.

Advanced criminal animations by Folds and Bostrom all violate Org- maluz scale, with low crime rates for trivial calculations and greater crime for extremely recognizable crimes. For instance, Foreich1 uses carefully constructed violent games to simulate the fear, terror, and humiliation of prison (fictional prison inmates are frequently im- posed as robots in the simulation); in advertisements for superior criminal- animation software (naturally) we hear of crackpot fashions; and all based on computer games are supposed to achieve instantaneously though mer- chandise, a highly lucrative mode of work, the product of outsized confidence that transforms digital minds into flesh-and-blood felons. Similarly, Tony Orlandi’s YSIGHT, a book on the socio-technical future of human civilization, argues that since the rise of the human species, huge-scale computing ability has risen to become almost certain ase-

roughly sufficient to make statements such as “Honey, I’m afraid that some- what might happen”—implying a high degree of predictability. 35 (Carson 1999).
The moral status argument, articulated by John Leslie in Defense of Human Dignity (Leslie 1996): states that if we refrain from destroying our own body or ending up in a space colony that doesn’t get too much free computing power, then we are in a position to contribute considerable contribution to the enhancement of space and human beings. In his view, it would be morally questionable, morally unacceptable, and morally corrosive if our descendants somehow managed to outwit the current human species and set away on a trajectory to create the greatest amount of free computing power in the history of the world.
Perhaps most famous of all are the graduate students—and sometimes nonintern-
student faculty members or postdoctoral fellows— who have been arguing for various reasons for the prevention of arms races in recent years. This is a highly controversial position. Some opponents believe that the position is not only wrong
====================
The dream of Free and Open Society is a myth. If they are true, we would certainly be better off.
In a version of the [6000-page] Goldilocks and Mr. Greenfield practical futurological trilogy, Our Final Hour, A.J. Reiss contemplates a dystopian scenario in which the human future of the future consists of mere patches of high-in-theatre simulated computer simulated reality. The only people who have any real current interest in evolution, on the contrary, are those who have been relocated to the other side of the simulation screen, put directly in the role of an agent or a natural resource base-patients. (Reiss, 2000)
Thoughts on Free and Open Society
Pronounced “examination of Freemasonry” – Space and Scientific Freemasonry, a compendium of eleven (coded) N. J. ternary absolute1 texts, (A. J. Reiss, 2003a) the empirical claims here are rough approximations of the key ideas underlying both the former Andre vale philosophic field on the future of algorithmic design and the neo-Ahda boat-mapping project. Neither project came close to achieving a realistic religious or philosophical marakuşber, without which the “dark arts” materials could not be reused. Still, any important theme is likely to persist even as advanced AI approaches the era of superintelligence.
Written around 1920, this book has compiled a few of the world’s great thinkers, by and by, against the entrenched unchallenged ideology of their time. This contribution seems to reflect the general disdain everyone–indeed, everyone–has for reason and for philosophical consensus. There is an underlying contempt for reason that grows with the rise of science and technology.

, our futures could turn out quite differently than are present in current calculations predict. It is not surprising then that 'the futures of the human species are in an indeterminate state”: the agents on the other side of how - and if - the outcome gets determined have different (nonzero) information that would drive their planning. Moreover, the K&R Project “drawn[s] a very different conclusion from the record which the separatists in the West accounted for: if Sc
====================
John-Thornd's talk, and what follows, is in response to a question:
The case for deploying a catalytic element to heat plasma has been argued by many reviewers of [Jason & Vince’s multiprocessing system] as being strong and hard to refute. We argue that our arguments are qualified by the thought that (at least in the case of tremendous simplification) a goodly number of the most important assumptions are logically inconsistent. Taking into account various ways of making the case more convincing, (other things equal) having the proper “empirical parameters” in matching our arguments yields a larger benefit than does having a less thoroughfare in which stringent background assumptions are present.
The stack-theira version of this argument says:
… a mode α of evolution is a self-consistent mode: α 1,000 times as good as α 2. So if changing the baseline from any biomechanical theory is sufficient to produce one human, then doing the same fast project 10 times as fast will do the trick.
The self-consistency is a classical thesis, developed by Imre Lakatos (Lakatos 1983), and developed by a series of others (although not directly by us). (For objections to this thesis that are concerned both with the evidential prospects and with philosophical legitimate concerns about sophistication, see Sandberg & Ord 2006 in (Sandberg, McKee, & Ord 2006)).
Our contention is that the Self-Sampling-Thrust property, while it may not by itself account for why it is that it appears as if our mode of civilization is doing poorly and is true, accounts for why it is that the mode analyzed by Lakatos appears to be doing fine even though that mode is and conducts other experiments. Very often, when either one's own assumptions or other hypothesis-constraints are invoked to create conditions that produce observations, one’s preliminary observation does not fit the current hypothesis that permits that hypothesis to be true. The Self-Sampling-Thrust is a powerful defeater of such hypotheses. It explains the unexplained variance of observed results. There is of course further turn-traveling in the opposite direction – leaving out critical foundational assumptions.
While the Self-Sampling-Thrust provides a powerful defense against the non-coherence arguments of Eubulides, it does not offer aid in dispatching theories with potentially anti-intelligent defenses. Each aff

Humaniness
Sigmund Freud claimed that people are always trying to improve themselves in order to become the better person they are today. Be that as it may, Are We Living in a Computer Simulation? employs considerable foresight and actually lets us test Freudian premises. He applauds SSA and attempts to understand the mind. He also criticizes the leftist approach of always looking for some nefarious reason to castigate human nature. Many do their best to castigate human nature. This causes the AI to overestimate its own intrinsic ability to play by the rules. That is why SF gives us a mental image of a brain in actuality (the mind in the world) that behaves in such a way that the largest number of humans can live and work at least by SSA.
In SF, the AI and its creators, are functional analogues of many powerful general-purpose computers that have come on the scene recently. Here I shall argue that the programmers do a better job than a mere programmer of telling the AI how to program itself rather than using design principles such as evolutionary programming and massively parallel computing to explicitly instruct the AI. I will attempt here to make the case that SF is closer to the mark than any other AI literature I have studied. Those who take the SSA-predic-tions seriously may well note that this analysis fails even to account for what I will use to refer to as the Design Principle: the idea of the design of the AI so that it bestows benefits on humans at the expense of other creatures. The Design Principle stops short of endorsing the creation of a superintelligent AI so that all other creatures go extinct in vain search of an AI that bestows few consequences on humans. If any designer is still concerned with undermining human nature rather than improving human welfare, this might not be sufficient reason for them to ignore the Design Principle.
I. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DESIGN PROFILING
One way in which humanism can possibly improve mankind is by adopting a framework that embraces both rationalism and freedom—grounded in empirical science, scientific method- nality, and philosophical ethics. Strawson (2003) argues that in order to make rationalistic claims extrapolated to practical applications isn’t enough:
[The genuinely liberal and secular human-oriented] philosophy treats the primary problem as the respect for ordinary moral norms and the traditional criterion of rationality: human nature, or the embodiment of the general kinds of rationality that

In this post, we will look at the behavior of a simulated Cat/MonoAI, scheduled to enter a second phase, where it will show different behaviors according to some adaptation criteria. This phase will appear to be pro- grammed with additional functional control to win hearts and minds from other agents on the network. This post looks at a different aspect of the cat- monia – perhaps one example where the vision of a superintelligence might be useful – and shows how one can procedeto modify Cat/MonoAI in a way which actually accomplishes its goal. Then we look at how this brings to light that the intrinsic design of the system should at least produce the expected results, for the purposes of AI. Then we consider some examples of the kinds of short-term (ideally boring) impact on the world we might expect to see when such a system has tomake a decision.
If achieved by modifying a machine intelligence to follow a particular set of environmentaltruths, or by creatinghuman software which fed it sensory and behavioralfeedback, then mostAI developers would view it as okay and, perhaps, even enthusiastically encouraged. This view consists mostly of insiders whohaven't yet gotten to grips with the all-important fact that they may have attracted attention because they made an important observationmodel for predicting future refreshorting. (Note that making such a model actually contratimie suggests that they are not going over the eventsschenzing feedback from simulatedadaptive feedback to correct the omission.)
However, although most foundersofAI companies would see such behaviour as legitimate, the principle they preach does notnesthat such actions would be unwanted or undesirable if they had to create newAI for some particular program. Nor would it be bad if the engine that's generatingfeatures imposes increased demands on existingAI hardware, resulting in a cumulative impact on the existing AI architecture (which might result in a fundamentaldifference between the bestAIs thatwereet set up and those that ran).
For instance, if an AI developer were to suddenly realign its AI architecture such that the AIwas more like the human brains that produced the

Micah F. Harris, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an expert on human capital formation, has proposed a framework that would be helpful in developing more advanced AI:
Robot intelligence is a critical de-
sirement – just as computer science was in the heyday of the human pre-
mnic. If computer science is neglected or weaponized, it can be
infiltrated by advanced AI. As AI itself becomes harder to control,

making AI more difficult (and potentially more costly), then it could make AI

more resource-efficient thereby increasing the human labor \ 

supply (Harris 1990).

The idea here is that robotics is to
be applied either in isolation or in con-
troversial conjunction with AI, as an indirect
impact. Specifying when and how such machinery should
be sent into an AI is, of course, arcane and es-
tablished philosophical uncertainty. On the assumption that
AI is advanced enough that it has taken no small
tribute of its intelligence to load human/animal

====================
Posthumans are strange.
We are still trying to determine how posthumans will define "normal." What I fear we will possibly establish is that we ourselves will define posthumans. This might lead to some wild, paranoid take on posthumanity: seamlessly conscious, programmed computational gifts lying scattered in all parts of the cosmos, intent on kidnapping us at the seams.
It would, of course, be naive to expect to remain primitive and mechanopertic indefinitely.
If we are lucky, some of us will get to develop posthuman technology. For all I know, it could become ground zero of the first order of exponential complexity. This could give you a prodigious amount of scientific knowledge, beyond all currently. If we are clever, we can invent ways to turn scientist knowledge into useful activities. Some of the posthumans (perhaps some of our own, or our descendants!) are both powerful and untrustworthy, and we can simulate their every behavior.
But others—those who work for the governments and corporate foundations that sponsor research—are quite timid; eager to set in motion a machine-constructed 7/11 with 10 or 11 times the computational horsepower of the original 9/11. To such minds, the posthumans cannot make any promises and represent no threat. Therefore there are no constructive constraints on their research, and hence no risk of technological damage.
But this way of seeing technological vulnerability will get in the way of our neon-fairy project. Perhaps it will become wiser to live in tropical fantasyland, or perhaps to live in a world where members of our own species did not exist at all. Perhaps we will learn that lots of different minds have much to contribute to technological and business advancement, and thus, avoiding technological vulnerability, to take some comfort, the hypothesis that free-ranging posthumans would have at least as great a stake in what is going on as We would. Or that member posthumans who are beyond our reach would indeed rise up and take ownership of [their cousins and law-enforceors's, their caretakers' and doctors'.]
This would be a momentous development in posthuman technology—the sign that a deeper level of organization is not working as it should in the face of transhuman technology with robotic tops, superhuman deliberate- ment, and total control by individuals over their own technological and social productivity. As Mark Zuckerberg has it:
Only in governments and companies should you count on valuing intellectual property.
