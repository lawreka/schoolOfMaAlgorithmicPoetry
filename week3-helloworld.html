<body>
    <div>due to advances in medical technology</div>
    <div>some people born without hearing now gain the sense later in life</div>

    <div>among their surprises is the fact that the sun</div>
    <div>combusts in silence</div>

    <div>there is no constant hum above us</div>
    <div>like a refrigerator or fluorescent bulb</div>

    <div>as it broils and beats down on asphalt,</div>
    <div>it should spit, hiss, and roar</div>

    <div>it could babble or burble</div>
    <div>as it dapples the forest floor</div>

    <div>its perfect light and heat so distant</div>
    <div>and yet close enough to bathe in</div>
</body>
