    <div class="q">
        Finding your metaphor<br />
        How do you write?<br />
        What do you want to research?<br />
        What does writing means to you and how can you describe your writing experience?<br />
        What does your writing practice mean to you?<br />
        For those who already write code, you can try to think about it in your own coding practice

<div class="a">
To me, writing is a magical art. Writing is a form of alchemy, or transmutation - the transmutation of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/">qualia</a> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_reality">consensus reality.</a><br/>
<br />
Bringing something into being for others that only exists in our own ephemeral, subjective perceptions is a form of magic. The author conjures the sensation of biting into a crisp, juicy apple by arranging words and if they are a skilled enough illusionist, the reader can feel its skin against their own teeth. Poetry is a particularly potent form of conjuration, able to invoke entire worlds and lives of experience with minimal verbiage.<br/>
<br />
Writing code is a kind of magic that allows us to commune with unseen forces that although deterministic are also somewhat mystical - crystal clocks and hovering magnetic plates inside of machines humming with invisible electronic energy. And with regards to artificial intelligence, I find it fascinating to try to use the exchange of language via writing human-code (written words) and programming language to explore the potential for machine qualia, and the dialogue between us and all of the electrical energy of the universe - not just that which we harness via computing.</div>

    <h1>Week 2</h1>

    <div class="q">
        Can you make the <a href="week2-lovelettergenerator.html">love letter generator</a> be more human?<br />
        Can you change the word database for it to perform about other topics?<br />
        What kind of topics would be relevant?<br />
        How does the work change by modifying the complexity of its processes?<br />
        What does the texts gain from that action?<br />
        Will the statement of the work be different if we increase/decrease its complexity?<br />
        Who is going to read it?

<div class="a">
I wanted to give the love letter generator a modern twist. Instead of chaste love letters to "darling duck" etc., these are the sort of communications you can expect from your lover in the 21st century. (It's a <a href="week2-sextgenerator.html">sext generator</a>).<br/>
<br />
I changed the word database to a be predominantly emojis and some suggestive openers like "u up?" and signoffs that include "jk... unless ur into that". The sext machine generates three messages: an opening text chosen from the list of openers, a suggestive "i want" statement consisting mainly of emojis and an optional bridging statement between them like "in ur", and a signoff expressing the sender's current emotion: love, lust, embarrassment, or trepidation.<br/>
<br/>
The selection of emojis consists of many (like 🍑 and 🍆) that are already used in a sexual way, and many that are not particularly sexualized (like 🚗, 🔨, and 🍗). This mixture often makes the output a bit absurd. Some of my favorite mixed message sets were:<br/>
<br/>
hey 😏<br/>
id luv 2 💋 all over ur 🧠 <br/>
💕 🤪 😝<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
u up?<br/>
what would you do if i 🩸 🔪 <br/>
😳 😬 😬<br/>
<br/>
I tweaked the CSS from the original to make it look like receiving text messages, and changed the interface so that you receive one set of 3 messages per click of the "click 2 sext" button instead of the endless generation in the original M.U.C. example. For sexts in particular, I thought it's better if the reader has some agency about when they're going to see them. An endless stream of sexts, even if these ones aren't all explicit, could be distressing, and this way the funny ones are easier to save since they won't be moving or disappearing until you generate a new one.

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <div class="q">
        Can you write a program that says Hello World? What would you think is more relevant to try for beginners? Search for other Hello World examples? Bring a small anthology<br />
        Can you think of a use for non executable code? Have you found any element in your code or others' code that may have cultural significance?<br />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="a">
    This week, I took the "hello world" prompt in a different direction, thinking about the larger natural/universal implications of that statement, and writing code as worldbuilding. The idea of non-executable code also made me think of parts of writing code that as engineers we may find annoying or deem "non-essential," which fall under the banner of accessibility. Making web pages accessible and navigable by screenreaders is often an afterthought that I wanted to bring to the fore with this assignment.<br>
    <br>
    I used VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader appliation for Mac, to read my poem which is printed in white text on a white screen. The text refers to the wonder of the natural world and how we navigate it with different senses. You can <a href="week3-helloworld.html">visit the poem here</a> or listen to it being read by VoiceOver below.
